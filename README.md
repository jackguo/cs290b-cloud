###Description
The assignment that each student will need to complete by the end of 
the course is to produce a cloud-based search and/or optimization 
system that attempts to improve the known bounds on the seventh symmetric Ramsey Number -- R(7,7). 

The goal is to find the largest set of non-isomorphic counter 
example graphs each having the largest node count. Students will 
present the the their respective implementations at the end of 
the course and the student or team with the largest set 
will be crowned the winner of Ramsey Search for CS290 in 2015.

### Project Deliverables

* some number of Ramsey counter examples for R(7, 7)
* output from the Nauty isomorphism checker that certifies the counter examples are not isomophic
