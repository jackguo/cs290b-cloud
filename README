The assignment that each student will need to complete by the end of the course is to produce a cloud-based search and/or optimization system that attempts to improve the known bounds on the seventh symmetric Ramsey Number -- R(7,7). Each student or student team will find counter example graphs for R(7,7). The goal is to find the largest set of non-isomorphic counter example graphs each having the largest node count. Students will present the the their respective implementations at the end of the course and the student or team with the largest set will be crowned the winner of Ramsey Search for CS290 in 2015.
